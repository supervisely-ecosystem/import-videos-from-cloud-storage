# Overview

This apps allows to import videos from most popular cloud storage providers to Supervisely Private instance.

List of providers:
- Amazon s3
- Google Cloud Storage (CS)
- Microsoft Azure
- and others with s3 compatible interfaces

App supports two types of import:
1. copy videos from cloud to Supervisely Storage (pros: fast video streaming, cons: data is duplicated)
2. add videos by link (pros: data will not be duplicated, cons: video streaming lags are possible - it depends on 
   cloud configuration)

⚠️ Notice: for any of these import types app downloads video to its temp directory, processes it and extracts some 
technical information like timestamp-frame index mapping, number of streams, resolution and so on. Once the video is 
processed, it will be removed from temp directory. This is the one time procedure.

# How To Use

   configuration files or in Admin UI dashboard. Learn more in docs: [link1](https://docs.supervisely.com/enterprise-edition/installation/post-installation#configure-your-instance),
